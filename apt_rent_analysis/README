This directory is for a project to model apartment rents based on the unit's proximity to MTA stations, Starbuck's, and Whole Foods. 

Gathering the data for this project turned out to be a much more difficult task than expected, so the majority of the work so far was just 
data collection. In the next few weeks I expect to run this data through a linear model and provide visualizations. 

When that happens I'll post results and analysis.
